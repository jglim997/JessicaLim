            <h1>Hi! My name is Jessica Lim, and I am a UX designer studying Human Computer Interaction
            and Business Administration at Carnegie Mellon University. I enjoy the smell of spring air and
            focus on living a well-balanced life. I enjoy sincere and genuine connections with the people around me 
            and in all the things that I do. I am a constant observer and thinker with aspirations in channeling these aspects of my
            character to better the environments around me and the people I get to interact with.

            <i class="em em-volleyball" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="VOLLEYBALL"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;I will almost never pass on an opportunity to play ultimate frisbee and volleyball. <br>
            <i class="em em-snowboarder" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="SNOWBOARDER"></i> &nbsp;Wintertime is for snowboarding and drinking hot chocolate.<br>
            <i class="em em-sunrise_over_mountains" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="SUNRISE OVER MOUNTAINS"></i>&nbsp; Summertime is for picnics and bike rides. <br>

            <p>"Why human-centered design?"</p>
            <h1>I am passionate about human-centered design, because it embodies so much of what I value and look to achieve in my career.
                Human-centered design focuses solely on the user and in making their experiences seamless and positive. I truly believe in
                importance of good UX design for any product that customers come across and in the ways that it can accomodate for all the 
                ways that a users wishes to interact with a given product or interface. 
                <br><br>Human-centered design requires empathy and thought over thought for the user, for others.
            </h1>

            <p>"What do you look forward to?"</p>
            <h1>Contrary to what others may think, I look forward to my 30's! This may seem rather strange, but I look 
                forward to the continuous growth in maturity and age, and building our lives is something to celebrate
                and enjoy as each day comes. <br><br>
                I also look forward to growth in my career as a UX designer and in all the things that I enjoy doing in my spare time 
                such as volleyball, frisbee, and snowboarding!
